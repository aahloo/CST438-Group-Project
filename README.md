**HOW TO USE API**
>Note: The bolded phrases are the parts that need to be changed. For testing and production, proposes, examples working within provided demos are working data.
Acceptable Cities to be used are: **Denver**, **Los Angeles**. Other cities exist within the database such as **Boston**, **New York**, and **Hawaii**, but your results may vary as not all cities are completely designed to work together. Date range from **08-18-2020** to **08-22-2020** are the valid for searching. Due to the limited scope of the test data within the database, this is all that can be provided. Demo results below are for example only, your results may vary based on your inputs.

**TO SEARCH FOR ___ONE___ FLIGHT**

To retrieve flight data for **one** direction, follow the following url scheme locally:
>localhost:8080/api/FlightDate/**08-18-2020**/DepartureCity/**Denver**/ArrivalCity/**Los Angeles**

API Failure (or empty search result):
>Returned 404 status.

**TO BOOK A FLIGHT**

Requires **two** seatInfo.id from the previous API call.Meaning, you will have to search for flights total of **two** times for a round trip. Program only handles round trip at this time. One for departure to destination, and one from destination back to origin. When these two ID's are provided into the API, a singular value will be returned. This is your BookingID. Store this with your user as you will need this for all things related to the booking.
